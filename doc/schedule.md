# Schedule

Interview process takes 6 to 8 weeks, first step of the
process is the written assessment.

It involves general problems solving and tech knowledge interview, after
one week the recruiter will contact with the next steps

it is mostly a yes or no answer, don't anticipate much of feedback really

How you get the answer is as important as the answer itself,
solve the problem in a logical way, while asking questions,
clarifying anything that comes out as vague,

1. Technical interview

   - 12-15 minutes problems
   - walk through the problems, hints if unable to make progress
   - dont tell the solution immediately, work your interviewer through your
     thought process, think of it as of a maths problem
   - two questions about webtech - how the internet works, study each of the
     topics, know how the things work separately and as a whole
   - two questions about chosen area of expertise, in my case programming
     (using the interview google doc)
   - take notes as you are working through the problem to keep yourself
     organised and possibly backtrack your progress
   - make sure you review the preparation materials, there is the most
     information there

2. General Cognitive Ability (problem-solving) interview

3. Leadership and Googleyness interview

   - how you work with others
   - how you tackle ambiguity

4. Customer and Project Management interview

   - how you manage projects and customer relationships
