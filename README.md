# Interview Preparation

- webtech - self selected area of expertise

- prep guide from the email

- review the prep material thoroughly

- past experience where I have shown leadership, how I influenced others

- group prep sessions, have a look at the link, no need to attend both

## Interview Guide

1. Take some time to think through the problem, don't speak straight away.

   - clarify, ask questions get to the root of the problem
   - do not think superficially
   - follow up questions are very important
   - state any assumptions

2. Walk through your approach

   - answer the question,
   - don't tell the solution but go through the steps
     think of it like a math problem where you go thorugh each of the steps

3. make notes as you are doing the interview
4. use the STAR method for open ended questions
