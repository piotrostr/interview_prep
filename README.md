## Interview Guide

- don't speak straight away
- take some time to think through the problem,
- do not think superficially

- clarify, ask questions get to the root of the problem

  - _"What is the budget"?_
  - _"How many people are invited?"_
  - _"Where is it going to take place?"_
  - ...

- state any assumptions

  - _"I will assume there will be a facilities team to help"_
  - _"I will also assume the budget will be $xxxxK"_
  - ...

- work through the problem

  - _"Since the objective is to welcome new Googlers to the office, 
    I would ensure that I'm inclusive of all googlers in my planning
    and bring in local food vendors, find fun activities for noogles
    and their families to do."_

Remember to make notes as you are doing the interview.
